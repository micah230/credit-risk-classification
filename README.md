In this Challenge, we use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. We use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. We will do this in the following three steps:
    1. Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
    2. Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
    3. Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report
